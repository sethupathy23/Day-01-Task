Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2?

what is HTTP?

1.HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol and it is used in client-server communication.
2.By using HTTP user sends the request to the server & the server sends the response to the user.
3.There are several stages of development of HTTP/1.1 which was created in 1997 & the new one is HTTP/2 which was created in 2015.

HTTP/1.1:-

For better understanding, let’s assume the situation when you make a request to the server for the google.
Html page & server responds to you as a resource google.html page.
Before sending the request and the response there is a TCP connection established between client & server.
Again you make a request to the server for image img.jpg & the server gives a response as an image img.jpg.
The connection was not lost here after the first request because we add a header which is the part of the request.
So there is an open connection between the server & client.
There is a persistent connection which means several requests & responses are merged in a single connection.
These are the drawbacks that lead to the creation of HTTP/2: The first problem is HTTP/1.1 transfer all the requests & responses in the plain text message form.
The second one is head of line blocking in which TCP connection is blocked all other requests until the response does not receive.
All the information related to the header file is repeated in every request.

HTTP/2:

HTTP/2 was developed over the SPDY protocol. HTTP/2 works on the binary framing layer instead of textual that converts all the messages in binary format.
It works on fully multiplexed that is one TCP connection is used for multiple requests. HTTP/2 uses HPACK which is used to split data from header.
It compresses the header. The server sends all the other files like CSS & JS without the request of the client using the PUSH frame.

Difference between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 are:-

HTTP/1.1:-

1.It works on the textual format.	
2.There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn’t get its all resources.
3.It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages.
4.It compresses data by itself.

HTTP/2:-

1.It works on the binary protocol.
2.It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
3.It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages.
4.It uses HPACK for data compression.

Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript?

Objects in JavaScript is the most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript.
These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol)
In the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).


1.Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
2.An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. 
That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables don’t actually store the value.
3.Objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs.
 These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.


An object can be created with figure brackets {…} with an optional list of properties.
 A property is a “key: value” pair, where a key is a string (also called a “property name”), and value can be anything. 
Let us visualize this with the following syntax for creating an object in JavaScript.

Syntax:-

var object_name = {

    key_name : value;
    
}

Example:-

let school = {
    name : "Laurel Higher Secondary School",
    location : "Thanjavur",
    established : 1989
}
